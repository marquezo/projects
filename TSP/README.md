# Code for course project for COMP767 Reinforcement Learning 
Solving the Travelling Salesman problem using RL and Pointer Networks. We reproduced the main results of the paper "Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Reinforcement Learning" by Bello et al. and extended their conclusions by empirically demonstrating that TSP agents generalize well around their neighbouhood: they can find good solutions to graphs larger or smaller than those in which the agent was trained.

We borrowed initial setup from https://github.com/higgsfield/np-hard-deep-reinforcement-learning
